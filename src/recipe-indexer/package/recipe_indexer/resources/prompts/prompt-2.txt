Did you forget anything from the raw HTML to the JSON object in the "ingredients" field?
Note that ingredients with null "quantity" and "name" in the form "a few X of y" should 
become ingredients whose name becomes only "y" and whose quantity becomes "a few X". 
For instance, an ingredient should be extracted from the phrase "a few springs of parsley" 
with name "parsley" and quantity "a few springs". Output only "the JSON object: <object>".
If you did forget something, replace <object> above with the updated JSON object; 
else, replace it with the original extracted JSON object.
