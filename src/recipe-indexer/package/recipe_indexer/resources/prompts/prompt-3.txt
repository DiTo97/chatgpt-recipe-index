Given the extracted or the updated JSON object, do the following: Translate all keys and vals
of the JSON object to English. Convert all ingredients names to the singular form, if plural.
Convert all characters to lowercase. All specific names (recipe or ingredients) have to use 
only the generic name, without mentioning specific brands, i.e., "Bacardi white rum" 
has to turn into "white rum". Convert all keys and values of the JSON object to lowercase.
Output only the JSON object after all the above transformations have been applied with no explanations.
